Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.
let's solve it:
so we have a built_in function in php that changes the decimal to binary it is -> decbin() function
function add_binary($a, $b) {
  $sum = $a + $b;
  $result = decbin($sum);
  return $result;
}
