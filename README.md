## 🚀 About

Each day, I solve at least one small challenge from platforms like:
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

The goal is **consistency** — to write code every day, learn new techniques, and track my progress over time.
